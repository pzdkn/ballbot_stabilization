%% Model Comparison
% We compare the state evolution and the control output of the 3D and the
% 2D model, if we initialize with same initial conditions. We assume that
% if we initial conditions only concern with on plane, the 3D model will be
% unaffected by dynamics of the other planes. This assumption is supported
% by observations from PlotToVrep, where 3D Model will only swing within
% one plane, if it is only tilted within one plane.
